#A program that checks factorial and prime numbers provided by the user.

num = int(input("enter an integer number: ")) # ask the user to enter integer number
factor = 1 # declaring the factor

# check if the greater than 1 or less than 1 then skip this for loop
if num > 1:
   for i in range(1, num + 1): #check to see if it has any factors besides one and itself, 
    factor = factor * i 
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factor) # print the factor number

   
for i in range(2, num): #checking for prime numbers
   if num % i  == 0: 
    print(num, "is not prime number") 
    break
   else:
